This repository contains a simple C program that illustrates a potential memory corruption bug due to improper handling of pointer arithmetic. The main function demonstrates the use of pointers to modify the value of a variable. While this example is straightforward and works correctly in most cases, it fails to explicitly check for pointer validity and writability, which can lead to severe issues in more complex programs.  The bugSolution.c file provides a corrected version, highlighting safe pointer manipulation practices.
